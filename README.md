# Hi All!

## I wanted to include some documentation and context with some of my provided examples.  If you have any addiotnal questions please feel free to ask. 

## Swift:

### Static:
#### Unfortunately I'm having some compatibility issues opening this project on my new Mac.  Still working on getting some code examples of this project added to the Box folder. I've included a recording of an older version of the app running just as a point of reference.

### Clicker Game:
#### Simple game thats calculates the users score based on how many times the user clicks the button.  A slider is used as a score multiplier to increase the score per click.  Game levels are simulated by background color change, capped at 1000.  This app was intended to be an example and introductory project to learn Xcode during my workshops.

## Other/Design Examples:

### Personal Website:
#### A never ending project - Web based resume built with Bootstrap.

### JacobRobinett.oucreate.com:
#### Photography portfolio created for a co-worker, this site was created as a part of an OU web design copmetition.  Top menu auto scrolls to different sections of the site. (site hosted on OU servers, can be a bit slow to load initially)
